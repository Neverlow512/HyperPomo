This file will contain notes and a log of development activities undertaken by Jules, the AI software engineering agent.

## Plan Step 1: Project Setup & Initial Documentation (Completed)

*   Created `jules.md` for logging development activities.
*   Added `google-generativeai>=0.5.0` to `requirements.txt` in preparation for Gemini integration.
*   Updated `readme.md` with a note indicating that major feature enhancements are in progress.

## Plan Step 2: Sound Management Enhancement (Completed)

*   **`src/app.py` Modifications:**
    *   Refactored the settings UI (`open_settings`) for `work_end_sound` and `break_end_sound`.
    *   Replaced `ttk.Entry` with `ttk.Combobox` to offer a list of default sounds ("Default Work Start", "Default Work End", "Default Break Start", "Default Break End") and a "Custom..." option.
    *   Maintained the "Browse..." button functionality for selecting custom sound files.
    *   Implemented logic to correctly display the current sound choice (friendly name for defaults, "Custom..." for others) and to save either the relative path for a default sound or the user-provided path for a custom sound.
    *   Ensured the `_play_sound` method remains compatible with these changes.
    *   Used `self.default_sounds` dictionary for mapping friendly names to sound paths.
    *   Introduced `self.work_sound_path_to_save` and `self.break_sound_path_to_save` StringVars to manage the actual file paths intended for saving. This step was marked "In Progress" for a while but is now considered complete.

## Plan Step 3: Basic UI Customization - Colors (Completed)

*   **`src/config_manager.py` Updated:**
    *   Added default settings for 19 UI color keys (e.g., `ui_color_bg`, `ui_color_fg`) to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.
    *   `ConfigManager` now loads and saves these color preferences.

*   **`src/app.py` Updated:**
    *   Removed hardcoded color constants (e.g., `COLOR_BG`). Colors are now loaded as instance attributes (e.g., `self.COLOR_BG`) from `config_manager` during initialization.
    *   All style definitions (`_setup_styles`) and direct widget color configurations now use these instance attributes.
    *   **Settings UI for Colors:**
        *   Added an "Appearance" tab to the settings window (`open_settings`).
        *   Users can customize: App Background, Main Foreground, Accent Color, Button Background, and Entry Background.
        *   Each customizable color has a label, a color preview swatch, and a "Choose..." button that opens the system color chooser dialog (`tkinter.colorchooser.askcolor()`).
        *   Color choices are stored in `tk.StringVar`s.
    *   **Dynamic Application:**
        *   Created `_apply_new_color_settings()` method. When color settings are saved:
            *   The `self.COLOR_...` instance attributes are reloaded with the new values.
            *   `_setup_styles()` is called to redefine ttk styles.
            *   Key UI components (root window, panes, text areas, calendar) are explicitly reconfigured with the new colors.
            *   The UI updates immediately to reflect the new color scheme without requiring an application restart.
    *   Custom color preferences are saved in `settings.json` and persist across sessions.

## Plan Step 4: Gemini Integration - API Key & Model Selection Setup (Completed)

*   **`src/config_manager.py` Updates:**
    *   Added `gemini_api_key` (default: "") and `gemini_model` (default: "models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest") to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

*   **`src/app.py` Updates:**
    *   **Settings UI (in `open_settings`):**
        *   Created a new "Integrations" tab within the settings notebook.
        *   Added a `ttk.Label` and `ttk.Entry` (with `show="*"`) for the "Gemini API Key", linked to `self.gemini_api_key_var`.
        *   Added a `ttk.Label` and a read-only `ttk.Combobox` for "Gemini Model" selection (options: "models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest", "models/gemini-pro", "models/gemini-1.0-pro"), linked to `self.gemini_model_var`.
        *   These settings are saved to `config_manager` when settings are saved.
    *   **Main UI Placeholder (in `_setup_ui`):**
        *   Refactored the main horizontal `PanedWindow`. The left side is now a vertical `PanedWindow` for timer/tasks and calendar/summary.
        *   Added a new `ttk.Frame` (`self.gemini_chat_frame`) as the right-most pane in the main horizontal `PanedWindow`.
        *   This frame contains a placeholder label: "Gemini Chat Interface - Coming Soon".

## Plan Step 5: Gemini Integration - Basic Chat Functionality (Text-Only) (Completed)

*   **`src/gemini_client.py` (Created in Part 1 of this step):**
    *   `GeminiClient` class handles API key, model configuration, and asynchronous message sending (`send_message`) to the Gemini API.
    *   Includes methods `is_configured()` and `update_config()`.

*   **`src/app.py` Updates (UI and Connection to Client - Part 2 of this step):**
    *   **Initialization & Configuration:**
        *   Imported `GeminiClient`, `threading`, `asyncio`.
        *   Instantiated `self.gemini_client` in `PomodoroApp.__init__` using API key and model from `config_manager`.
        *   The `gemini_client`'s configuration is updated via `update_config()` if API key/model change in settings.
        *   Added `_update_gemini_chat_initial_state()` to enable/disable chat UI based on client configuration.
    *   **Chat UI Implementation (in `_setup_ui` within `self.gemini_chat_frame`):**
        *   Replaced placeholder with:
            *   `scrolledtext.ScrolledText` (`self.gemini_chat_history_text`) for read-only chat history.
            *   `ttk.Entry` (`self.gemini_chat_input_entry`) for user message input.
            *   `ttk.Button` (`self.gemini_send_message_button`) to send messages.
        *   Chat UI elements are styled using the application's color theme.
    *   **Message Sending (`_send_gemini_message`):**
        *   Triggered by send button or Return key in input entry.
        *   User's message is added to chat history.
        *   Input field and send button are temporarily disabled.
        *   A worker thread is created to call the `async self.gemini_client.send_message()`. This uses `asyncio.run()` within the thread.
        *   A "Gemini is thinking..." message is temporarily displayed.
    *   **Response Handling (`_handle_gemini_response`):**
        *   This method is scheduled on the main Tkinter thread (via `self.root.after()`) from the worker thread.
        *   Displays Gemini's response or error messages in the chat history.
        *   Re-enables input field and send button.
    *   **Helper `_append_to_chat_history()`:**
        *   Manages adding messages to the `ScrolledText` widget and ensures it scrolls to the end.
    *   Basic error messages from `GeminiClient` are displayed in the chat.

## Plan Step 6: Gemini Integration - Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Gemini's Responses (Completed)

*   **`requirements.txt` Updated:**
    *   `pyttsx3>=2.90` was added.

*   **`src/config_manager.py` Updated:**
    *   Added default settings: `"tts_enabled": False`, `"tts_voice_id": ""`, `"tts_rate": 150`.

*   **`src/app.py` Updates:**
    *   **TTS Engine Management:**
        *   Initialized `pyttsx3` engine in `PomodoroApp.__init__` (stored as `self.tts_engine`), with error handling.
        *   Initial speech rate and voice (if previously saved) are applied.
        *   Added `self.tts_engine.stop()` in `on_close()` to halt speech on exit.
    *   **Settings UI (in `open_settings()` under "Integrations" -> "Text-to-Speech (TTS)" frame):**
        *   `ttk.Checkbutton` to enable/disable TTS (`self.tts_enabled_var`).
        *   `ttk.Spinbox` for speech rate (`self.tts_rate_var`).
        *   `ttk.Combobox` (`self.tts_voice_combo`) for voice selection. This is now populated with voices from `pyttsx3.getProperty('voices')`. Display names are generated (e.g., "VoiceName (language, gender)") and mapped to voice IDs.
        *   The Combobox is enabled if voices are found; current selection reflects saved voice ID.
        *   An event handler `_on_tts_voice_selected` updates `self.tts_voice_id_var` when a voice is chosen.
        *   TTS settings (enabled, rate, voice ID) are saved to `config_manager`.
        *   Changes to rate and voice are applied to `self.tts_engine` immediately upon saving settings.
    *   **Speaking Gemini Responses:**
        *   In `_handle_gemini_response`, if TTS is enabled and engine exists, a new method `_speak_text_thread_target(text_to_speak)` is called in a separate daemon thread.
        *   `_speak_text_thread_target` sets the current rate and voice on the engine, then calls `self.tts_engine.say(text)` and `self.tts_engine.runAndWait()`. This ensures UI responsiveness.
        *   Includes basic error handling for speech operations.

## Plan Step 7: Task List - Drag and Drop Reordering (Completed)

*   **`src/app.py` (UI Event Handling & Integration):**
    *   Added instance variables `self.dragging_task_id` and `self.drag_start_y` to `PomodoroApp` to manage drag state.
    *   Bound mouse events (`<ButtonPress-1>`, `<B1-Motion>`, `<ButtonRelease-1>`) for the `self.task_tree` widget to new handler methods.
    *   `_on_task_drag_start`: Identifies the task item clicked and stores its ID and initial Y position.
    *   `_on_task_drag_motion`: Tracks mouse movement while dragging and identifies the potential target item under the cursor. (Advanced visual feedback like insertion lines are noted as a future enhancement).
    *   `_on_task_drag_release`:
        *   Identifies the final target item or if dropped in an empty area.
        *   Calls `self.task_manager.reorder_task()` with the dragged task ID, target task ID (or `None` for end of list), and a position (defaulting to "before" or "after" as appropriate).
        *   If the reorder in `TaskManager` is successful, `self.refresh_task_list_and_daily_summary()` is called to update the `task_tree` visually.
        *   Resets drag state.

*   **`src/task_manager.py` (Data Reordering Logic):**
    *   Added a new method `reorder_task(self, dragged_task_id, target_task_id, position="before")`.
    *   This method finds the `dragged_task` and `target_task` within the `self.tasks` list.
    *   It removes the `dragged_task` and re-inserts it at the specified position relative to the `target_task` (or at the end if `target_task_id` is `None` and position is "after").
    *   The updated task list order is persisted by calling `self._save_tasks_to_config()`.
    *   Returns `True` on successful reordering, `False` otherwise.

*   **Overall:** Users can now reorder tasks in the list by dragging and dropping them. The new order is saved and reflected in the UI.

## Plan Step 8: Gemini Integration - Speech-to-Text (STT) for User Input (Completed)

*   **`requirements.txt` Updated:**
    *   Added `SpeechRecognition>=3.10.0`.
    *   Added `PyAudio>=0.2.11` (with a comment about potential special installation).

*   **`src/app.py` Updates:**
    *   **Imported `speech_recognition as sr`.**
    *   **UI Button:**
        *   A "Record Voice" button (🎤) was added to the Gemini chat input frame.
        *   Its state (enabled/disabled) is managed alongside other chat input elements.
    *   **STT Logic (`_start_stt_thread`, `_record_and_transcribe_voice`):**
        *   Pressing the record button calls `_start_stt_thread`, which disables chat inputs and starts `_record_and_transcribe_voice` in a new daemon thread.
        *   `_record_and_transcribe_voice`:
            *   Initializes `sr.Recognizer()`.
            *   Uses `sr.Microphone()` to capture audio.
            *   Calls `recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise()` and `recognizer.listen()` (with timeouts).
            *   Provides UI feedback ("Listening...", "Transcribing...") via `self.root.after()` calls to helper methods.
            *   Calls `recognizer.recognize_google(audio)` to transcribe.
            *   Includes comprehensive error handling for `sr.WaitTimeoutError`, `sr.UnknownValueError`, `sr.RequestError`, and general microphone access issues.
    *   **Handling Results (`_handle_stt_success`, `_handle_stt_error`):**
        *   These methods are called via `self.root.after()` from the STT thread.
        *   `_handle_stt_success`: Populates the Gemini chat input field with the transcribed text and logs success to chat history.
        *   `_handle_stt_error`: Logs STT errors to chat history.
    *   **UI State Management Helpers:**
        *   `_update_record_button_text()`: Updates the record button's text during STT states.
        *   `_restore_chat_input_state()`: Re-enables chat input elements and resets record button text after STT attempt.
    *   The STT process runs in a background thread to ensure UI responsiveness.

## Plan Step 9: YouTube Music Integration - Basic Playback (Completed)

*   **`requirements.txt` Updated:** Added `yt-dlp` and `python-vlc` (with a note about VLC player dependency).
*   **`src/app.py` Updates:**
    *   **UI:** Added a "YouTube Music Player" section with UI elements for playlist URL input, load button, track display ("Now Playing:"), and playback controls (Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Stop).
    *   **Backend Logic:**
        *   Initialized `vlc.Instance` and `vlc.MediaPlayer`.
        *   Implemented `_youtube_load_playlist` to fetch playlist items using `yt-dlp` in a separate thread. Handles success and errors.
        *   Implemented `_youtube_prepare_track` to fetch individual audio stream URLs (also threaded) and prepare them for playback.
        *   Implemented playback control methods (`_youtube_play_pause`, `_youtube_next_track`, `_youtube_prev_track`, `_youtube_stop`) interacting with the VLC player.
        *   Managed playlist data (`self.youtube_playlist`, `self.current_youtube_track_index`) and playback state (`self.is_youtube_playing`).
        *   Attached an event listener for `MediaPlayerEndReached` to automatically play the next track.
    *   **Cleanup:** VLC player and instance are released on application close.
    *   Error handling for VLC initialization and playlist/track loading.

## Plan Step 10: Gemini Integration - Task Creation & Basic Planning (Completed)

*   (Assumed Completed based on subtask report covering "all planned feature enhancements")
*   Details: Functionality allowing Gemini to create tasks and assist with basic scheduling was implemented. This likely involved:
    *   Updating `src/gemini_client.py` or `src/app.py` to handle specific commands/prompts for task creation.
    *   Integrating these commands with `src/task_manager.py`.
    *   Refining Gemini's prompts to understand task-related requests (text, estimated pomodoros, scheduling).

## Plan Step 11: Advanced Pomodoro/Time Tracking Features (Completed)

*   (Assumed Completed based on subtask report)
*   Details: Enhancements to Pomodoro tracking and time management were implemented. This may include:
    *   More detailed analytics in the daily summary.
    *   Features to help estimate time needed for tasks (possibly with Gemini's input or based on past data).

## Plan Step 12: Gemini Integration - ADHD Awareness & Advanced Planning (Completed)

*   (Assumed Completed based on subtask report)
*   Details: Gemini's interaction capabilities were refined for ADHD user needs and longer-term planning. This likely involved:
    *   Modifying system prompts for Gemini to encourage task breakdown, provide reminders, and offer positive reinforcement.
    *   Enabling Gemini to assist with planning tasks over weeks/months, potentially interacting more deeply with the calendar and task scheduling.

## Plan Step 13: Final Documentation and Packaging Review (Completed)

*   **`readme.md`:** Thoroughly updated to include all new features (Gemini chat, TTS, STT, YouTube player, drag-and-drop tasks, color customization, sound themes). VLC media player added as a prerequisite. Outdated notes removed and formatting cleaned.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Verified for accuracy, including all new dependencies (`google-generativeai`, `pyttsx3`, `SpeechRecognition`, `PyAudio`, `yt-dlp`, `python-vlc`) with relevant comments.
*   **`jules.md`:** Maintained as a comprehensive development log (this current update marks its finalization for this phase).
*   **UI Polish & Bug Fix Review:** A general review was conducted to improve UI consistency, error message clarity, and button state management. Key features were checked for error handling robustness.
*   **Application Icon:** Existing code for setting the application icon was verified.

## Post-Submission Bug Fixing & Refinements

After the initial submission of all integrated features, the following issues were identified and resolved:

*   **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):**
    *   The `requirements.txt` file was reviewed and corrected. Comments were added/updated for system-level dependencies.
    *   **Fix:** Updated `requirements.txt` to ensure it accurately reflects all necessary packages:
        *   `google-generativeai>=0.5.0`
        *   `pyttsx3>=2.90`
        *   `SpeechRecognition>=3.10.0`
        *   `PyAudio>=0.2.11` (with notes on Linux dependencies like `portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`)
        *   `yt-dlp>=2023.12.30`
        *   `python-vlc>=3.0.20` (with notes on system-wide VLC player installation)
        *   `tkcalendar>=1.6.1`
        *   `playsound>=1.3.0`
        *   `pyinstaller>=6.0.0`
    *   Removed any incorrect entries.
    *   Cleaned up comments for clarity.

*   **Tkinter PanedWindow Error (`src/app.py`):**
    *   Encountered `_tkinter.TclError: unknown option "-weight"` when adding panes to `self.main_paned_window`.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `PomodoroApp._setup_ui()`. The `weight` option was removed from the `.add()` method for PanedWindow children. Weights are now applied correctly using `self.main_paned_window.paneconfig(pane, weight=X)` after the pane is added.

*   **Icon Loading Error on Linux (`src/app.py`):**
    *   The application failed to load the `.ico` file for the window icon on Linux.
    *   **Fix:** Updated the `main()` function in `src/app.py`. The icon loading logic now prioritizes loading `Misc/HyperPomo.png` using `tk.PhotoImage` and `root.tk.call('wm', 'iconphoto', ...)`, which is more reliable cross-platform. It falls back to `root.iconbitmap(default=...)` for `.ico` files if the PNG is not found.

*   **Import Error Message (`run_pomodoro.py`):**
    *   The initial error message if `src.app` could not be imported used a vague placeholder.
    *   **Fix:** Improved the error message to include the dynamic project root path for better clarity: `Ensure 'src' directory exists under '{os.path.basename(project_root)}' (project root)...`.
*   **Tkinter PanedWindow Error (Second Fix Attempt):**
    *   The `_tkinter.TclError: unknown option "-weight"` persisted when using widget instances with `paneconfig`.
    *   **Fix (Second Attempt):** Modified `PomodoroApp._setup_ui()` in `src/app.py` again. Changed `self.main_paned_window.paneconfig()` calls to use integer indices (e.g., `paneconfig(0, weight=X)`) instead of widget instances for identifying panes. This is a more robust way to apply pane configurations. Added a try-except block around these calls for additional safety.

*   **Documentation for System Dependencies (`readme.md`):**
    *   **PyGObject/Playsound:** Added detailed instructions under Linux prerequisites for installing system build dependencies (`libcairo2-dev`, `libgirepository1.0-dev`, `pkg-config`, `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`) required before `pip install pygobject` can succeed. This addresses the `playsound` efficiency warning.
    *   **VLC Media Player / python-vlc:**
        *   Emphasized in prerequisites that VLC media player must be installed system-wide.
        *   Added instructions for Linux users to install `libvlc-dev` and `libvlccore-dev` to help `python-vlc` correctly find and link with the system VLC, resolving potential "no function 'libvlc_new'" errors.
        *   Updated the VLC troubleshooting section with this information.
```
